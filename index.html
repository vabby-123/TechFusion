        <p>        The outline of Tech Fusion Club is “Technical Combination”. Tech Fusion club is 
            basically formed to enhance technical level of students other than regular 
            curriculum. Tech Fusion Club benefits the students for creating products that 
            revolutionize market. It helps the students to transform core technologies into 
            application technology. Tech Fusion Club organizes TECH FEST every year and 
            numerous technical events on various occasion as LASER Show, ROBO RACE, 
            Robotics based events etc. <br>
          We emphasize upon combining technology with education. Now, the question is that
how important is technology in education? The COVID-19 pandemic is quickly demonstrating why online education should be a vital part of teaching and learning. By integrating technology into existing curricula, as opposed to using it solely as a crisis-management tool, teachers can harness online learning as a powerful educational tool.

The effective use of digital learning tools in classrooms can increase student engagement, help teachers improve their lesson plans, and facilitate personalized learning. It also helps students build essential 21st-century skills.

Virtual classrooms, video, augmented reality (AR), robots, and other technology tools can not only make class more lively, they can also create more inclusive learning environments that foster collaboration and inquisitiveness and enable teachers to collect data on student performance.

Still, it’s important to note that technology is a tool used in education and not an end in itself. The promise of educational technology lies in what educators do with it and how it is used to best support their students’ needs.
